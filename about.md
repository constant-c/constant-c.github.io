About Me
========
I am a PhD student at [Chalmers University of Technology][chalmers] in Gothenburg, Sweden. 
As part of the Automation group at the Department of Electrical Engineering, my research focuses on Reinforcement Learning with imperfect experts. 
Before re-joining Chalmers, I have been a Data Scientist and Release Manager in Perth, Australia. 
I hold a M.Sc. in Production Engineering from Chalmers and a B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management from the [University of Hamburg][hwi], Germany.
